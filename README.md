# ROS2 Turtlesim Project üê¢

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **ROS2** with the **Turtlesim** package to manually draw a shape (square) using keyboard controls.  
The process started by installing **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** and **ROS2 Humble** on a virtual machine, then launching the turtle node and controlling it through the appropriate topic.

---

## Requirements
- **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**
- **ROS2 Humble**
- `turtlesim` package installed

---

## Installation
After installing Ubuntu 22.04, ROS2 Humble was installed using the official ROS2 installation guide.  
The Turtlesim package was installed via:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlesim

‚Äî-

Running the Project

1. Launch the Turtle Node
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

This node is responsible for launching the simulation window and displaying the turtle.

2. Control the Turtle
Open a new terminal and run:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key

This node listens to keyboard inputs and sends movement commands to the topic /turtle1/cmd_vel.


Understanding Nodes and Topics
	‚Ä¢	Node: A process that performs a specific task in ROS2.
In this project:
	‚Ä¢	turtlesim_node ‚Üí Displays the simulation and updates the turtle‚Äôs position.
	‚Ä¢	turtle_teleop_key ‚Üí Reads keyboard input and sends movement commands.
	‚Ä¢	Topic: A communication channel between nodes.
In this project:
	‚Ä¢	/turtle1/cmd_vel ‚Üí Receives velocity commands from turtle_teleop_key and applies them in turtlesim_node.

‚∏ª

Drawing the Shape
	1.	Used the ‚Üë arrow key to move forward.
	2.	Used the ‚Üê arrow key to rotate 90 degrees.
	3.	Repeated the process 4 times to draw a square.
	4.	The final drawing appeared in the turtlesim_node simulation window.


Result

A perfect square was drawn manually using ROS2 and the Turtlesim package.

Conclusion

This project showcases the basics of working with ROS2 using nodes and topics, and demonstrates how to interact with a graphical simulation through keyboard teleoperation.
